# üí≤ Flutter App "iSubscriptions"

A Flutter app based on the design of "Subscription App" *by Amruta A. Panganti*, see more on: [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/5454871-Subscription-App-Freebie-UI-Kit).

This app is designed for iOS, so I've focused on the Cupertino-widgets. This was quite a new learning experience because these widgets worked slightly different.

## Getting Started üöÄ

- Clone the repo
- Install the dependicies
- Run it

## Preview

The app is based on Amruta's design, see a preview of the Flutter app result:
